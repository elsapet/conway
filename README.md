# Conway's Game of Life

> "Life, uh... finds a way" -- Dr. Ian Malcolm

Conway's Game of Life is a two-state two-dimensional cellular automaton, with the following rules

1.) A living cell dies if it has less than two living neighbours
2.) A living cell dies if it has more than three living neighbours
3.) A living cell stays alive if it has between two and three living neighbours
4.) A dead cell revives if it has exactly three living neighbours

From these four simple rules, complex patterns and behaviour result.
